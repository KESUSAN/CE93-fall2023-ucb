    "## About the Lab\n",
    "In this lab, we will be working with a data set of Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), Nitrates, and Ammonia measurements along the Blackwater River. Biochemical oxygen demand, or BOD, is a measurement of the amount of oxygen consumed by the microorganisms in decomposing organic matter in some volume of water. Additionally, BOD can also be used to measure the extraction of oxygen from water via oxidation of inorganic matter, a chemical reaction as opposed to a biological one. \n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"figure1.png\">\n",
    " \n",
    " From EPA: Water Monitoring and Assessment: \n",
    "“BOD directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen in rivers and streams. The greater the BOD, the more rapidly oxygen is depleted in the stream. This means less oxygen is available to higher forms of aquatic life. The consequences of high BOD are the same as those for low dissolved oxygen: aquatic organisms become stressed, suffocate, and die.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrates are a very common contaminant of drinking water, especially in rural areas near agriculture. The primary sources of nitrate contamination are fertilizer, sewage, and manure. Federal regulations for nitrates were put in place because high nitrate levels can result in methemoglobinemia, or \"blue baby\" disease. They are also an indicator for other major agricultural contaminants, such as pesticides and bacteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ammonia in waterways is the result of industrial processes, wastes, and fertilizers, as well as a byproduct of drinking water disinfection with chloramines. Ammonia is toxic for aquatic life, especially in oxygen-poor environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Civil and Environmental Engineers, BOD, Nitrates, and Ammonia measurements are critical to protect the health of waterways that are impacted by various organic and inorganic pollution. The consequences of high BOD could be species depletion, damaged ecosystems, polluted water, regulatory challenges, and criminal investigations.  "
